# Details about the Tiger game 
Overview 
The tiger game is a traditional Chinese board game. It is a strategy game for two players. One player, who plays the tiger, has only one piece. The other player has 18 men. The tiger must eat the men, who must block the tiger so that he cannot move. The game can be played with any kind of pieces that can be distinguished from one another. The board is 8×8 squares, with the addition of a square of 2×2 squares, which is called the tiger's lair.

Play
The men cannot take the tiger, but can only block him. The tiger, by jumping over a man, can take it, in which case the man is removed from play. The men must stay together 2 by 2 to block the tiger. In general, if a tiger eats more than three pieces, it is unlikely that men will have enough pieces to win the game. If the men do not make mistakes, but move cautiously, victory is likely.
